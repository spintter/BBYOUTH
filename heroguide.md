Design Concept Overview
Visual Theme
Background: A dark cosmic backdrop (#1A1A2E) inspired by DFFRNT ERA, featuring subtle glowing particle effects (simulated with CSS animations or canvas elements). This sets a futuristic yet grounded tone, reflecting BBYM's mission of guiding youth toward a bright future.

Central Element: A 3D chessboard with chess pieces (e.g., kings, queens, pawns) as the focal point, utilizing the provided /public/models/pawn.glb (a 3D GLTF model) rendered with Three.js or a similar WebGL library. The chessboard symbolizes strategy and empowerment, aligning with the theme "Empowerment Through Strategy."

Animation: On page load, chess pieces will move chaotically in 3D space using GSAP or Three.js animations. As the user scrolls, the pieces will snap into a structured grid formation, creating a dynamic transition from chaos to order—a metaphor for BBYM’s transformative impact on youth.

Typography: Bold, large-scale text ("Empowerment Through Strategy") in a modern sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat or Poppins), with a gold accent (#FFD700) to reflect cultural heritage and prestige, mirroring DFFRNT ERA’s minimalist yet impactful typographic style.

Interactivity: Subtle hover effects on CTAs, a scroll indicator, and responsive design for seamless mobile and desktop experiences.

Color Palette
Primary Background: #1A1A2E (deep cosmic black)

Accent: #FFD700 (gold, symbolizing value and heritage)

Text: #FFFFFF (white for contrast), #D3D3D3 (light gray for secondary text)

Particle Effects: #00CED1 (dark turquoise glow)



3D Rendering: Three.js to load and animate the /public/models/pawn.glb file, creating a realistic 3D chessboard experience.

Animation: GSAP with ScrollTrigger to handle the chaotic-to-ordered chess piece animation on scroll, complemented by Three.js for 3D motion.

Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom utilities for rapid prototyping and responsiveness.

Assets: Leverage /public/models/pawn.glb for the 3D pawn model, supplemented by custom SVGs or PNGs for other chess pieces (king, queen, etc.) if needed.
