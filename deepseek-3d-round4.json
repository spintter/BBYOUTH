SPIR-V cross-compilation\n\n2. **Cultural Elements:**\n- Authentic Akan facial features in models\n- Procedurally generated kente patterns with historical accuracy\n- Transformation sequence incorporates Sankofa bird symbolism\n\n3. **Animation System:**\n- Dual quaternion skinning for smooth deformations\n- Motion prediction for fluid transitions\n- GPU-based particle system for transformation effects\n\n4. **Performance Safeguards:**\n- Automatic texture downscaling based on device PPCM\n- Triangle density throttling for thermal management\n- Progressive loading with predictive prefetching\n\nThis specification balances technical requirements with cultural authenticity while maintaining strict performance boundaries across devices. The hybrid LOD system and WebGPU-first approach ensure optimal rendering while the material definitions preserve visual fidelity.","reasoning_content":"Okay, I need to create a JSON specification for the optimized 3D model integration in a Next.js app based on the experts' input. Let me go through each section step by step.\n\nFirst, the model loading system. They mentioned using glTF with Draco and KTX2 compression. So I'll include each model with LOD levels. The African girl model is 16KB, so maybe it's already optimized. The queen is 47KB. I'll need different LODs for each, specifying distances. Also, fallbacks for WebGL if WebGPU isn't supported. Don't forget the decoder paths and preloading.\n\nNext, materials. The AfrocentricMaterials.tsx has custom PBR materials. I need to define each material type: skin, clothing, crown, etc. The Cultural Art Director emphasized authentic patterns, so texture paths should point to those. Using KTX2 textures with Basis compression makes sense. Specular and roughness values should reflect realistic materials, like the crown having higher specular.\n\nLighting setup needs an environment map, probably from public/textures. HDRIs are good for PBR. Adding directional, ambient, and accent lights to highlight the models. The Performance Engineer would want minimal lights to reduce draw calls.\n\nAnimations include transformation sequences. The African girl transforms into the queen. So skeletal animations for each model, plus a procedural animation for the transition. The Animation Specialist mentioned easing functions and particle effects. I'll need to specify duration, easing, and particle parameters like count and size.\n\nPerformance optimizations: LODs, compressed textures, instancing if possible, frustum culling. Also, using WebGPU when available. Memory management involves caching models, unloading unused assets, and texture streaming. The Asset Pipeline Engineer would want texture resolutions adjusted based on distance.\n\nCultural authenticity checks: symbols on clothing and crown, correct patterns. The Art Director's input ensures textures reference Adinkra symbols and Kente patterns. Also, the transformation should have symbolic elements like Sankofa birds.\n\nPutting it all together in JSON structure. Sections for model_loading, materials, lighting, animations, performance, memory, cultural_checks. Each part with parameters and values. Make sure paths are correct, and all optimizations are listed. Check that every expert's input is reflected in the respective sections.\n\nWait, did I miss the draco and basis decoders? Yes, in model_loading, each model has compression settings with decoder paths. Also, the scripts/download-decoders.js is part of preloading. Need to include that.\n\nFor materials, each has baseColor, normal, roughness, etc., with texture formats. KTX2 for everything. Maybe mipmaps enabled. The crown's material has emissive properties for the gemstones.\n\nLighting includes environment_map, directional, ambient, and accent lights with intensities and colors. The directional light casts shadows, so shadow map parameters are there.\n\nAnimations have separate entries for each model and the transformation. Particle effects during transformation with specific settings. Also, animation pooling to reuse instances.\n\nPerformance strategies list all techniques used, like LOD, compression, instancing, culling. Memory management includes caching policies, texture streaming details, and garbage collection.\n\nCultural checks ensure all symbols are properly referenced and transformation symbolism is included. Final check for texture paths and model accuracy.\n\nI think that covers all the requirements. Now structure this into a coherent JSON with proper nesting and sections. Make sure it's clear and implementable."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":497,"completion_tokens":2235,"total_tokens":2732,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":320},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":709},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":320,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":177},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5417b77867_prod0225"}
