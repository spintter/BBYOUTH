## Implementation Details

### Model Loading System

We've implemented an enhanced model loading system with the following features:

1. **Optimized GLTF Loader**
   - Uses Draco compression for geometry
   - Supports KTX2 texture compression with fallbacks
   - Automatically optimizes materials and textures

2. **Memory Management**
   - Tracks and reports memory usage for textures and geometry
   - Implements proper cleanup and disposal of resources
   - Optimizes texture resolution based on device capabilities

3. **Cultural Material System**
   - Detects and applies culturally appropriate materials
   - Enhances skin, clothing, and royal elements with PBR properties
   - Implements proper subsurface scattering for skin materials

4. **Transformation Effects**
   - Smooth elevation animation during transformation
   - 360-degree rotation with particle effects
   - Proper model switching between girl and queen forms

### Required Files

The following files are required for the enhanced 3D model integration:

1. **Models**
   - `/public/models/african-girl.glb` - The African girl model
   - `/public/models/african-queen.glb` - The African queen model

2. **Decoder Files**
   - `/public/draco/draco_decoder.js`
   - `/public/draco/draco_decoder.wasm`
   - `/public/draco/draco_encoder.js`
   - `/public/draco/draco_encoder.wasm`
   - `/public/basis/basis_transcoder.js`
   - `/public/basis/basis_transcoder.wasm`

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install three @react-three/drei @react-three/fiber
   ```

2. **Download Decoder Files**
   ```bash
   node scripts/download-decoders.js
   ```

3. **Prepare Models**
   - Place your models in the `/public/models/` directory
   - Ensure they follow the naming convention: `african-girl.glb` and `african-queen.glb`

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. **LOD System Implementation**
   - Create three detail levels for each model:
     - High: 20K triangles
     - Medium: 10K triangles
     - Low: 5K triangles

2. **Advanced Texture Compression**
   - Convert all textures to KTX2 format
   - Implement adaptive texture resolution based on device capabilities

3. **Animation Enhancements**
   - Add more sophisticated transformation animations
   - Implement proper skeletal animations for the models

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the 3D models, check the following:

1. **Missing Decoder Files**
   - Run `node scripts/download-decoders.js` to download the required decoder files

2. **Model Loading Errors**
   - Ensure the models are in the correct format (glTF 2.0)
   - Check the console for specific error messages

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor memory usage in the developer console
   - Adjust quality settings based on device capabilities
