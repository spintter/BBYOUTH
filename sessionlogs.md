## Major Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: GLB Model Generation
**Problem**: Initial attempts to generate GLB models for African-styled chess pieces were failing due to incorrect usage of the GLTFExporter and gltf-pipeline.

**Solution**: 
1. Implemented a two-step export process:
   - First export to GLTF using Three.js GLTFExporter
   - Then convert to GLB using gltf-pipeline CLI
2. Added proper error handling and debugging
3. Fixed lighting setup for better model export

### Challenge 2: Server-Side 3D Model Generation
**Problem**: Difficulties with browser-specific APIs in Node.js environment.

**Solution**:
1. Added proper polyfills for Blob and FileReader
2. Created type definitions for vblob module
3. Implemented proper environment setup for server-side Three.js usage

## Current Project State

## Team Member Reports

### UX/UI Designer
"The current hero component needs better mobile responsiveness. Consider:
1. Adjusting camera positions for mobile viewports
2. Implementing touch controls for transformation sequence
3. Adding loading indicators for model initialization
4. Improving visual feedback during transformation stages"

### Design Architect
"Key architectural considerations:
1. Component structure is solid but needs better error boundaries
2. Consider implementing React Suspense boundaries around 3D components
3. Material system could be optimized for reuse
4. Need to implement proper asset preloading strategy"

### Visual Storyteller
"Narrative elements to enhance:
1. Add particle effects during transformation
2. Implement dynamic color schemes based on transformation stages
3. Consider adding subtle ambient sounds
4. Improve visual storytelling through material transitions"

### Performance Engineer
"Critical optimization areas:
1. Implement proper LOD (Level of Detail) for models
2. Add geometry instancing for repeated elements
3. Optimize material updates during animations
4. Consider implementing WebGL2 features when available
5. Add proper memory management for disposed objects"

### 3D Graphics Specialist
"Technical improvements needed:
1. Implement proper shadow mapping
2. Add ambient occlusion for better depth
3. Consider adding post-processing effects
4. Optimize geometry for better performance
5. Implement proper texture compression"
