NEVER DELETE ANY FILES BEFORE EXTENSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE RESEARCH O THE ISSUE AND CONFIRMATION FROM THE USER. 

NEVER NEVER JUST DIVEW INTO AN ISSUE AND START CHANGING CODE!

DO NOT HURT THA APP DO NOT HURT THE AP DO NOT HURT THE APP





Debug [codebase] while balancing:  
1. Fix criticality (CVSS ≥7.0 vulnerabilities)  
2. Backward compatibility preservation  
3. Tech debt reduction (≤10% increase)  
First iteration: Static analysis. Second iteration: Simulate Chaos Monkey attacks. Third iteration: Homomorphic encryption of error paths."
