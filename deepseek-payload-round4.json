Materials & Shading Expert (Expertise: PBR materials, advanced shading techniques, texture optimization)\n3. Performance Engineer (Expertise: Memory management, draw call optimization, LOD implementation)\n4. Cultural Art Director (Expertise: African aesthetics, cultural symbolism, authentic representation)\n5. Animation Specialist (Expertise: Skeletal animation, transformation sequences, procedural animation)\n6. Asset Pipeline Engineer (Expertise: glTF optimization, texture compression, model optimization)\n\nYou have access to the following file structure:\n- components/KnowledgeIsPowerChessboard.tsx (Main 3D scene component)\n- components/materials/AfrocentricMaterials.tsx (Custom materials)\n- public/models/african-girl.glb (16KB model)\n- public/models/african-queen.glb (47KB model)\n- public/draco/ (Draco decoder files)\n- public/basis/ (KTX2/Basis decoder files)\n- scripts/download-decoders.js (Utility for downloading decoder files)\n\nYour task is to analyze, critique, and progressively enhance the 3D implementation through 4 rounds of meticulous optimization, focusing on:\n1. Technical excellence (WebGPU support, memory optimization, performance)\n2. Cultural authenticity (accurate representation, meaningful symbolism)\n3. Visual quality (PBR materials, lighting, effects)\n4. User experience (smooth animations, responsive performance)\n\nIn the final round, provide a complete JSON specification for the optimized 3D implementation that meets all requirements."

This should include:\n\n1. Comprehensive model loading system with LOD, compression, and fallbacks\n2. Complete material definitions for all elements (skin, clothing, crown, etc.)\n3. Lighting and environment setup\n4. Animation and transformation sequences\n5. Performance optimization strategies\n6. Memory management approach\n\nThe JSON should be structured to allow for easy implementation and should include all necessary parameters, values, and configurations to meet our requirements for technical excellence, cultural authenticity, visual quality, and user experience."
