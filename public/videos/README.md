## Required Videos

### hero.mp4

A video file named `hero.mp4` should be placed in this directory to serve as a fallback for the 3D hero section. The video should:

- Be in MP4 format
- Have a resolution of at least 1920x1080
- Be optimized for web (compressed to a reasonable file size)
- Feature content related to youth, education, or African heritage
- Have a dark or neutral tone that works well with text overlays

The video will be displayed with reduced opacity and a gradient overlay to ensure text readability.
